dhcpcd (1:1.3.22pl1-4) unstable; urgency=high

    * Removed shopt command from preinst - not required (closes: #153452)
    * Added code to automatically copy enough configuration
      on upgrade to keep the machine on the net. (closes: #153293)
      Detailed change as follows.
      1) No longer stop existing daemon in preinst, instead copy config file
         for use in postinst.
      2) In postinst update /etc/network/interfaces, then stop old daemon, 
         then run ifup on the interface.
      3) Change depends to pre-depends on ifupdown, since it has to be
         functional for the above to work.

dhcpcd (1:1.3.22pl1-2) unstable; urgency=high

    * Added build-depends for debhelper (closes:#151884).
    * Do fixups from old version in preinst, not postinst. 
      This fixes a problem where the old init.d script mangled the
      newly installed files and left the package unusable.
    * Really close all the bugs meant to be closed by 1.3.22pl1-1.

dhcpcd (1:1.3.22pl1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
    * New maintainer.
    * New upstream. (closes:143657) (closes:143660)
    * Removed /etc/init.d/dhcpcd. dhcpcd is now started by ifup or the pcmcia
      package. This is corresponds with the mechanism used by pump.
      (closes:140288) (closes:127773) (closes:118039) (closes:121208)
    * Removed kernel 2.0.x support since debian now longer supports this
      kernel series. The latest upstream now allows compilation for
      2.0.x anyway, so the ancient and unsupported 0.70 source tree has gone
      as well. 2.0.x users can recompile the source package.
    * Added a wrapper (/sbin/dhcpcd) around the real binary (/sbin/dhcpcd-bin)
      which allows options to be set in /etc/dhcpc/config. ifup allows
      most common options to be set, but not some which may be useful, 
      and dhcpcd doesn't natively support a config file.
    * Do not allow dhcpcd to alter /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/ntp.conf or
      /etc/yp.conf by default: these all need settings in 
      /etc/dhcpc/config now. /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf is still supported
      for dnsmasq.
    * Removed strange diversion of /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/ntp.conf
      via symlinks.
    * Patched upstream to remove security hole associated with shell
      metachars in dhcpcd-<interface>.info. Without the patch talking to
      a DHCP server which returned a domain name of eg `rm -rf /` would
      cause big problems!

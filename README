For this source code release, two toolchains are required:

1. A MIPS little-endian toolchain. For example, hndtools-mipsel-linux-3.0
   from Broadcom Corporation. This toolchain is used to compile uClibc
   and Linux kernel.

2. A MIPS little-endian toolchain compiled with C++ and uClibc support.
   This toolchain is used to compile linuxigd. CPP_STAGING_DIR in
   Makefile must be modified to indicate the exact path of this toolchain.

Then, a "make" should suffice to build all GPL components of WGT634U.

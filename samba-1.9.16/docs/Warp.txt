Here is some advice from maxfield@ctelcom.uucp.netcom.com (Wade Maxfie
to use Samba with OS/2 Warp.

Note that you may also find ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/os2/new/os2net.faq
useful.



        Can I use Samba with Warp?

        Yes.  The MSClient software at ftp.microsoft.com in the Bussys
(lanman os2 directory) will work, sort of.  It is version 2.2c.

        First, uncloack os2ver.  (attrib -h -r -s c:\os2ver).  It is a
text file.  change netwksta.xxx to 20=netwksta.sys.  Also add
20=setup.exe.  Another change will be needed, a .vdd file.  I remember
it came up during the installation as being a wrong version.  I wrote
the name down, changed os2ver to include it, and restarted the
installation.

 Here is a copy of my os2ver

setup.exe
netbios.os2
nwifs.ifs
netwksta.sys
nwreq.sys
netbios.sys
ipx.sys
netvdd.sys

Re-cloak os2ver. (attrib +h +r +s c:\os2ver)

Run the installation from an OS/2 Box.  Note that your mouse wont work,
use the TAB key to move around, enter to select hilighted items.

Here is a copy of my Config.sys file regarding the Laman entries.
Note even though the version is 2.2c, it reports 2.2a in the text.

       If you have an NE2000 card, don't reboot, or you'll be sorry.
enable the automatic backup mechanism for recovering old config.sys and
other files in OS/2.  It paid for itself during this installation nightm
before I knew better!)

        Next, (or perhaps before this), if you have an NE2000 adaptor,
get the ns2000 files from hobbes.nmsu.edu (in ns2000.zip).  I manually
patched protocol.ini to refer to that adaptor, and copied it into my
c:\lanman directory.  Note that I also modified the driver to be loaded
in the config.sys to the ns2000.os2.  It might install as an "other"
adaptor.

      A command file "startup.cmd" is placed in c:\.  This file is
automatically run when OS/2 Warp starts.
Here is a copy of my startup file.  Note that Warp sometimes fails to
login properly to the server.  I solve this by checking for the
existance of a file, and rerunning the loing if that file fails to
exist.

@REM ==== LANMAN 2.2a == DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES == LANMAN
NET START WORKSTATION
:relogin
NET LOGON maxfield mypassword /y
rem net use f: \\packard90\d$
rem net use g: \\linuxone\cdromsdir
rem net use h: \\linuxone\public
:doOver
if not exist f:\wildcat\wildcat.exe goto relogin
@REM ==== LANMAN 2.2a == DO NOT MODIFY BETWEEN THESE LINES == LANMAN
exit

        Finally, the system expects to be on a domain with a domain
server.  BTW, TCP/IP and NetBeui allow simultaneous communication with
Os/2 lanserver 4.0, and Samba.  (Note: Lanserver 4.0 won't yet to
TCP/IP.  (Well,it might, but it crashes before I get to that point, so I
havent' been able to enable it))

I have not yet tried with only a SAMBA server on the domain.

    I would be glad to try to answer any questions at above e-mail
address, if I can.

There are some particular issues with Samba and Windows NT

=====================================================================
One of the most annoying problems with WinNT is that NT refuses to
connect to a server that is in user level security mode and that
doesn't support password encryption unless it first prompts the user
for a password.

This means even if you have the same password on the NT box and the
Samba server you will get prompted for a password. Entering the
correct password will get you connected.

The other major ramification of this feature of NT is that it can't
browse a user level non-encrypted server unless it already has a
connection open. This is because there is no spot for a password
prompt in the browser window. It works fine if you already have a
drive mounted (for example, one auto mounted on startup).

Samba should support encrypted passwords soon, which will solve this
problem.

=====================================================================
When you mount a printer using the print manager in NT you may find
the following info from Matthew Harrell <harrell@leech.nrl.navy.mil>
useful:

------------
        I noticed in your change-log you noted that some people were
still unable to use print manager under NT.  If this is the same problem
that I encountered, it's caused by the length of time it takes NT to
determine if the printer is ready.

The problem occurs when you double-click on a printer to connect it to
the NT machine.  Because it's unable to determine if the printer is ready
in the short span of time it has, it assumes it isn't and gives some
strange error about not having enough resources (I forget what the error
is).  A solution to this that seems to work fine for us is to click
once on the printer, look at the bottom of the window and wait until
it says it's ready, then clilck on "OK".

By the way, this problem probably occurs in our group because the
Samba server doesn't actually have the printers - it queues them to
remote printers either on other machines or using their own network
cards.  Because of this "middle layer", it takes an extra amount of
time for the NT machine to get verification that the printer queue
actually exists.

I hope this helped in some way...

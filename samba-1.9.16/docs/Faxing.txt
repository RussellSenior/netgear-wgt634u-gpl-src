This text describes how to turn your SAMBA-server into a fax-server
for any environment, especially for Windows.
   Author: Gerhard Zuber <zuber@berlin.snafu.de>

Requirements:
   UNIX box (Linux preferred) with SAMBA
   ghostscript package
   mgetty+sendfax package
   pbm package (portable bitmap tools)

FTP sites:
   mgetty099-May31.tar.gz
   I got it from: ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc/mgetty/mgetty099-May31.tar.gz


making mgetty+sendfax running:
==============================

   go to source tree: /usr/src/mgetty+sendfax
   cp policy.h-dist policy.h

   change your settings: valid tty ports, modem initstring, Station-Id

#define MODEM_INIT_STRING	"AT &F S0=0 &D3 &K3 &C1\\\\N2"

#define FAX_STATION_ID	"49 30 12345678"

#define FAX_MODEM_TTYS	"ttyS1:ttyS2:ttyS3"

   Modem initstring is for rockwell based modems
   if you want to use mgetty+sendfax as PPP-dialin-server,
   define AUTO_PPP in Makefile:

CFLAGS=-O2 -Wall -pipe -DAUTO_PPP

   compile it and install the package.
   edit your /etc/inittab and let mgetty running on your preferred
   ports:

s3:45:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/mgetty ttyS2 vt100

   now issue a
      kill -HUP 1
   and enjoy with the lightning LEDs on your modem
   your now are ready to receive faxes !


   if you want a PPP dialin-server, edit 
      /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/login.config

/AutoPPP/ -	ppp	/usr/sbin/pppd auth debug passive modem 



Tools for printing faxes:
=========================

   your incomed faxes are in:
    /var/spool/fax/incoming

   print it with:

     for i in *
     do
     g3cat $i | g3tolj | lpr -P hp
     done

   g3cat is in the tools-section, g3tolj is in the contrib-section
   for printing to HP lasers.



Now making the fax-server:
===========================

    fetch the file
       mgetty+sendfax/frontends/winword/faxfilter

    and place it in

      /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/

    prepare your faxspool file as mentioned in this file
      /usr/local/bin/faxspool

	    if [ "$user" = "root" -o "$user" = "fax" -o \
	         "$user" = "lp" -o "$user" = "daemon" -o "$user" = "bin" ]

    make sure you have pbmtext (from the pbm-package). This is
    needed for creaating the small header line on each page.

    make sure your ghostscript is functional. You need fonts !
    I prefer these from the OS/2 disks


    prepare your faxheader
      /usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxheader


    edit your /etc/printcap file:

# FAX 
lp3|fax:\
        :lp=/dev/null:\
        :sd=/usr/spool/lp3:\
        :if=/usr/local/etc/mgetty+sendfax/faxfilter:sh:sf:mx#0:\
        :lf=/usr/spool/lp3/fax-log:




    edit your /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf

    so you have a smb based printer named "fax"



The final step:
===============

    Now you have a printer called "fax" which can be used via
    TCP/IP-printing (lpd-system) or via SAMBA (windows printing).

    On every system you are able to produce postscript-files you
    are ready to fax.

    On Windows 3.1 95 and NT:

    Install a printer wich produces postscript output,
       e.g.  apple laserwriter

    connect the "fax" to your printer 


    Now write your first fax. Use your favourite wordprocessor,
    write, winword, notepad or whatever you want, and start
    with the headerpage.

    Usually each fax has a header page. It carries your name,
    your address, your phone/fax-number.

    It carries also the recipient, his address and his *** fax
    number ***. Now here is the trick:

    Use the text:
       Fax-Nr: 123456789
    as the recipients fax-number. Make sure this text does not
    occur in regular text ! Make sure this text is not broken
    by formatting information, e.g. format it as a single entity.

    The trick is that postscript output is human readable and
    the faxfilter program scans the text for this pattern and
    uses the found number as the fax-destination-number.

    Now print your fax through the fax-printer and it will be
    queued for later transmission. Use faxrunq for sending the
    queue out.

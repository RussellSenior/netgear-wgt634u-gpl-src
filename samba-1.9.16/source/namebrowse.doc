this module deals with queueing servers that samba must sync browse
lists with. it will always issue a name query immediately before
actually carrying out the NetServerEnum call, to ensure that time
is not wasted by a remote server's failure.

this module was created to minimise the amount of NetServerEnum calls
that samba may be asked to perform, by maintaining the name of a server
for up to a minute after the NetServerEnum call was issued, and
disallowing further NetServerEnum calls to this remote server until
the entry is removed.

samba can ask for a NetServerEnum call to be issued to grab a remote
server's list of servers and workgroups either in its capacity as
a domain master browser, as a local master browser.

samba does not deal with becoming a backup master browser properly
at present.

-------------
NOTE FROM TRIDGE:

Yes, samba can send these either in its capacity as a DMB or as a
MB. There are only two situations:

- If samba is a DMB then it should sync with the "local only" bit set
with any master browser that has sent it a "master announce".

- if samba is not a DMB then it can only sync with the DMB, and should
not set the "local only" bit.

Note that samba should never sync with other non-DMB servers when it
is not a DMB. 

Try to do a sync under any other circumstances is dangerous without a
multi-threaded nmbd. I have a print server at home that knows some SMB
and NBT, but if you try to sync browse lists with it then it clogs up,
and also clogs up nmbd while it times out the connection. If  we
follow  the above two rules then we can't get into this sort of
trouble as:

- if we are a DMB and a master browser sends us a "master announce"
then it is expecting to receive a NetServerEnum SMB connection soon,
and must be capabable of handling it.

- if we are not a DMB then we will only sync with the DMB, which must
be capable of doing this stuff or things are really in a mess :-)

/*************************************************************************
  do_browser_lists()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for finding an appropriate entry in the
sync browser cache, initiating a name query (which results in a
NetServerEnum call if there is a positive response), and then
removing all entries that have been actioned and have been around
for over a minute.


/*************************************************************************
  start_sync_browse_entry()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for initiating a name query. if a
positive response is received, then this will result in a
NetServerEnum api call.

samba will only initiate this process if it is a master browser
for this workgroup.

-----------
NOTE FROM TRIDGE:

I'd actually prefer to skip the name query completely if we can
resolve the DMBs name via gethostbyname(). For the name query to work
we either have to have WINS working, or we need to know the broadcast
address of the network that the DMB is on. This makes us too dependent
on too many thing being right.

If the gethostbyname() fails then sure, go for a normal name query,
but if it works then we have saved ourselves a lot of trouble and
gained a lot of robustness.

This is best handled by a generic "resolve netbios name" routine that
tries DNS first then resorts to WINS or bcast if that fails. It also
needs to cache the results.

/*************************************************************************
  add_browser_entry()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for adding a browser into the list of
servers to sync browse lists with. if the server entry has already
been added and syncing browse lists has already been initiated, it
will not be added again.


/*************************************************************************
  expire_browse_cache()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for removing entries that have had the
sync browse list initiated (whether that succeeded or not is beyond
this function's scope) and have been in the cache for a while.


/*************************************************************************
  add_browse_entry()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for adding a new entry into the list
of servers to sync browse lists with at some point in the near future.

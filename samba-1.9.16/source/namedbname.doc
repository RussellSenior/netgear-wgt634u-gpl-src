this module deals with the NetBIOS name database for samba. it deals
directly with adding, removing, finding, loading and saving of names.

/*************************************************************************
  search_for_name()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for finding a name in the appropriate part
of samba's NetBIOS name database. if the name cannot be found, then it
should look the name up using DNS. later modifications will be to
forward the request on to another WINS server, should samba not be able
to find out about the requested name (this will be implemented through
issuing a new type of samba 'state').

the name is first searched for in the NetBIOS cache. if it cannot be
found, then it if the name looks like it's a server-type name (0x20
0x0 or 0x1b) then DNS is used to look for the name.

if DNS fails, then a record of this failure is kept. if it succeeds, then
a new NetBIOS entry is added.

the successfully found name is returned. on failure, NULL is returned.


/*************************************************************************
  expire_names()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for removing old NetBIOS names from its
database. no further action is required.

for over-zealous WINS systems, the use of query_refresh_names() is
recommended. this function initiates polling of hosts that have
registered with samba in its capacity as a WINS server. an alternative
means to achieve the same end as query_refresh_names() is to
reduce the time to live when the name is registered with samba,
except that in this instance the responsibility for refreshing the
name is with the owner of the name, not the server with which the name
is registered. 


/*************************************************************************
  add_netbios_entry()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for adding or updating a NetBIOS name
in the database. into the local interface records, the only names
that will be added are those of domain master browsers and
samba's own names. into the WINS records, all names are added.

the name to be added / updated will be looked up in the records.
if it is found, then we will not overwrite the entry if the flag
'newonly' is True, or if the name is being added as a non-SELF
(non-samba) name and the records indicate that samba owns the
name.

otherwise, the name is added or updated with the new details.


/*************************************************************************
  remove_netbios_entry()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for removing a NetBIOS entry from
the database. the name is searched for in the records using
find_name_search(). if the ip is zero, then the ip is ignored.

the name is removed if the expected source (e.g SELF, REGISTER)
matches that in the database.


/*************************************************************************
  load_netbios_names()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for loading any NetBIOS names that samba,
in its WINS capacity, has written out to disk. all the relevant details
are recorded in this file, including the time-to-live. should the 
time left to live be small, the name is not added back in to samba's
WINS database.

 
/*************************************************************************
  dump_names()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for outputting NetBIOS names in two formats.
firstly, as debugging information, and secondly, all names that have been
registered with samba in its capacity as a WINS server are written to
disk.

writing all WINS names allows two things. firstly, if samba's NetBIOS
daemon dies or is terminated, on restarting the daemon most if not all
of the registered WINS names will be preserved (which is a good reason
why query_netbios_names() should be used).
 

/*************************************************************************
  find_name_search()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is a wrapper around find_name(). find_name_search() can
be told whether to search for the name in a local subnet structure or
in the WINS database. on top of this, it can be told to search only
for samba's SELF names.

if it finds the name in the WINS database, it will set the subnet_record
and also return the name it finds.
 

/*************************************************************************
  find_name()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is a low-level search function that searches a single
interface's NetBIOS records for a name. if the ip to be found is
zero then the ip address is ignored. this is to enable a name to
be found without knowing its ip address, and also to find the exact
name if a large number of group names are added with different ip
addresses.


/*************************************************************************
  remove_name()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for removing a specific NetBIOS entry
from a subnet list's records. only if the pointer to the entry is
in the list will the name be removed.


/*************************************************************************
  add_name()
  *************************************************************************/

this function is responsible for adding a NetBIOS entry into a
subnet list's records.


/*************************************************************************
  ms_browser_name()
  *************************************************************************/

this function returns True if the NetBIOS name passed to it is
^1^2__MSBROWSE__^2^1


/*************************************************************************
  name_equal()
  *************************************************************************/

this function returns True if the two NetBIOS names passed to it
match in name, type and scope: the NetBIOS names are equal.

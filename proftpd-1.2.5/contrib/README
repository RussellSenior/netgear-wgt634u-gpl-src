The contrib/ directory contains third-party scripts, binaries and proftpd
modules.  Such found here are completely unsupported by the proftpd team,
have not been tested and may or may not work as documented.  In other

Contents:

xferstats.holger-preiss (BSD license, I think)

	A port of the infamous wu-ftpd xferlog perl analysis script,
	w/ bug fixes and some modifications.  Useful for analyzing
	your /var/log/xferlog files.  See xferlog(5).

mod_read.c (License unknown - jan.menzel@gmx.de)

	A 3rd party module which implements a new configuration directive,
	"DisplayReadme."  The directive can be used to display a list
	of "readme" files, including their last modification date.
	See contrib/mod_readme.c for details.

mod_pam.c (GPL license - macgyver@tos.net)

        A 3rd party module which implements PAM (Pluggable Authentication
	Modules) support for proftpd.  An additional directive,
	AuthPAMAuthoritative, is available when using this module, which
	controls whether the authentication provided by PAM is absolutely
	authoritative over logins, or whether proftpd should try other
	authentications methods.

	To build with mod_pam, simply:

		./configure --with-modules=mod_pam

mod_ratio.c (GPL license)

	A 3rd party module (distributed w/ the debian proftpd package)
	which implements file/byte ratios in proftpd.  To install,
	run:

		./configure --with-modules=mod_ratio

	From the top-level source directory.  See the comments
	at the top of mod_ratio.c for add'l directives and usage.

mod_linuxprivs.c (GPL license)

	This module takes advantage of current Linux development kernel's
	(2.1.x) POSIX.1e security model enhancements (consisting of
	capabilities and capability sets at the moment).  Use of this
	module _greatly_ enhances security (for one thing, it makes
	escaping from a chroot'd jail next to _impossible_).  This
	module requires Linux kernel version 2.1.104 or newer.
	A modified version of the libcap library is included (see below)
	and automagically built when you include this module in your
	proftpd build.  Tested under Linux 2.1.122.  To build simply:

	./configure --with-modules=mod_linuxprivs

	For detailed information see README.linux-privs

libcap (Unknown license, probably GPL)

	This library provides the interface between mod_linuxprivs
	(above) and the capability syscalls in Linux 2.1.  YOU DO
	NOT NEED TO BUILD THIS LIBRARY.  If you include mod_linuxprivs
	in your proftpd build, running 'make' from the top-level directory
	will automatically build libcap and link it in.

Description: A kernel-based automounter for Linux
 Autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons. The
 automount daemons automatically mount filesystems when they
 are used and unmount them after a period of inactivity. This
 is done based on a set of pre-configured maps.
 .
 The kernel automounter implements an almost complete SunOS
 style automounter under Linux. Automounter version 4
 (autofs4) has to be enabled when compiling the kernel.
 Debian packaged kernels have it enabled.

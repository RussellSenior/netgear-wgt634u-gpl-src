autofs (4.1.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * rc.autofs.in closes: #273224
    - load /etc/default/autofs, added default/autofs from 3.*,
      closes: #217205, #219134
    - create pid files in /var/run/autofs/
    - check for existance of /etc/$map file for compatibility with 3.* autofs
    - on stop check if daemon has really been killed for all pid files
    - reload/restart|force-reload changed to work as in 3.* (ie policy
      conform).
    - made handling of short-form (ie not $maptype:$map) map specifiers in
      master maps compatible with debian autofs 3.* init.
    - getschemes falls back on "files" if no automount key is listed in
      nsswitch.conf.
    - catnismaps() checks for existence of ypcat and put both fallbacks for
      nis master map in getnismounts()
    - timeout options in master map supersede setting in daemonoptions and
      TIMEOUT, closes: #94776, #155418
    - fixed logic for restarts again (#161401, #127779)
    - make stop use start-stop-daemon's --retry feature, closes: #254810

    itself anywhere. closes: #211970
  * event.d script uses init script stop action for umounting stuff
  * lookup_ldap.c: applied patch by Jun Futagawa to show cause of ldap errors.

autofs (3.9.99-4.0.0pre10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected handling of start/reload/stop in init.d script
    so that only a single automount process per mount point
    is started instead of multiple. The problem existed because
    no .pid files were created. Now the `--pid-file' option
    is passed to automount. (closes: Bug#145665, Bug#131078)
  * Information about the command line is no more available
    in the .pid file. Instead, the init.d script reads this
    information from `ps ax'. So changes in /etc/auto.master
    should now be handled correctly. (closes: Bug#97192)
  * Better readable console messages from init.d script.
    (closes: Bug#140925)
  * Kill old, not yet stopped automount processes in postinst script
    while upgrading, since older versions of the prerm script
    didn't stop them while upgrading.
    Actually we would need a loop for making sure all are stopped.
    But this could lead us to an endless loop if a process couldn't
    be stopped.
  * Added tests for /etc/init.d/autofs if update-rc.d or
    /etc/init.d/autofs {start|restart} is called.
  * Adapted code for stopping autofs in prerm script to current
    debhelper fashion: always stop /etc/init.d/autofs (that is,
    also stop while upgrading).
  * Target `make-diff' in debian/sys-build.mk:
    Call $(CLEAN_TARGET) in $(BUILD_TREE).orig, too, so that
    .orig files created by patch(1) are removed in all these
    directories.

  * Add apm script, so unused automount file systems get unmounted on
    suspend.  Closes: #48499
  * Make messages in the init script more policy compliant.  Closes:
    #121949.
  * Oops.  Call dh_installmodules, so the file is actually installed.

  * Restarting the init script does a full stop/start, instead of a
    reload.  Closes: #84695.

autofs (3.1.4-8) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated auto.misc so that removable, writable devices are mounted
    with the sync option.  Closes: #65077.
  * Unified the parsing logic, so now both file and nis based auto.master
    parsing goes thru the same function.  As an added benefit, this allows
    for nested nis auto masters.  Closes: #66606, #66761, #66527.
  * Allow for nis auto masters to reference files as the source for a map,
    and for file auto masters to reference nis as the source.  Closes:
    #66288, #66436, #66532, #66800.
  * Added -nodev,nosuid to removable devices in auto.misc.  Closes: #66556.

    '+map [options]' to auto.master.  Closes: #65590.
  * Added a 'active' option to the init script.
  * Used the internal active function introduced above, to only remove
    pid files of automounts that have terminated, when calling the init
    script with stop.  Closes: #64212.

autofs (3.1.4-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * Acknowledge nmu fixed bugs.  Closes: #34576, #38200, #44366, #46638,
    #52716, #55066, #56316, #57347.
  * Add -r(--no-restart-on-upgrade).  Closes: #54859.
  * Depends on procps.  Closes: #53237.
  * Bugs fixed upstream in 3.1.4:
    * Arguments not passed to forked process, because of strtok.  Closes:
        #44586, #44767.
    * Uses upstream init script, as it supports debian.  Closes: #42945,
        #41876, #47471.
  * Applied slightly modified version of patch from bug report, to pass ro
    option to fsck.ext2.  Closes: #43633.
  * Fix race condition during unmount.  Closes: #52132.
  * Conflicts with samba <= 2.0.6, as that version is needed to be used by
    mount_generic.  Closes: #54788.
  * If /etc/auto.master exists, don't use nis.  You can add +auto.master to
    to /etc/auto.master if you want to combine nis and a local mapping.
    Also set the type to yp in getmounts().  Closes: #40032, 41008, #57225.
  * The upstream init script does not do module probing, as the old init
    script used to.  I don't feel it is this pkg's domain to do a modprobe.
    Closes: #60542.
  * Check to see if the directory already exists, before attempting to make
    it ourselves.  Closes: #21567.
  * Reassign bug #31251, which deals with mounting a directory from multiple
    hosts to mount.
  * Make /mnt/amnt during configure, and remove when purging.
  * Modify upstream init script to support force-reload.
  * Linitian clean.

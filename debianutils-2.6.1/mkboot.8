.TH MKBOOT 8 "7 February 2003" "Debian"
.SH NAME
mkboot \- makes a bootdisk
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B "mkboot [\-r rootpartition] [\-i] [kernel]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B mkboot
makes a bootdisk.
.P
By default the bootdisk will use the kernel
.I /vmlinuz
and the current root partition.  Use the
.B \-r
option to specify a different parition, and provide the new kernel
file directly to specify a different kernel.
.P
If invoked with the
.B \-i
option, it tries to make a Debian GNU/Linux system bootable after a new
kernel was installed by
.BR "/sbin/installkernel" "."
If GRUB is installed, it does nothing.  If LILO is in use, it runs
.BR "/sbin/lilo" "."
Otherwise, 
.B mkboot
will make a new bootdisk.
.SH "BUGS"
.P
mkboot is i386-specific.  Patches to correct this deficiency are welcome.

.TH RUN\-PARTS 8 "12 November 2003" "Debian"
.SH NAME
run\-parts \- run scripts or programs in a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B run\-parts
[\-\-test] [\-\-verbose] [\-\-report] [\-\-lsbsysinit] [\-\-umask=umask]
[\-\-arg=argument] [\-\-exit\-on\-error] [\-\-help] [\-\-version]
[\-\-list] [\-\-reverse] [\-\-] directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B run\-parts
runs all the executable files found in directory
.IR directory .
Other files and directories are silently ignored.

If the \-\-lsbsysinit option is not given then the names must consist
entirely of upper and lower case letters, digits, underscores, and
hyphens.                           
                                                                                
If the \-\-lsbsysinit option is given, then the names must not end
in .dpkg\-old  or .dpkg\-dist and must belong to one or more of the
following namespaces: the LANANA-assigned namespace (^[a\-z0\-9]+$);
the LSB hierarchical and reserved namespaces (^_?([a\-z0\-9_.]+\-)+[a\-z0\-9]+$);
and the Debian cron script namespace (^[a\-z0\-9][a\-z0\-9\-]*$).      

Files are run in the lexical sort order of their names unless the
\-\-reverse option is given, in which case they are run in the
opposite order.

.TP
.B \-\-verbose
print the name of each script to stderr before running.
.TP
.B \-\-report

reverse the scripts' execution order.

Use LSB namespaces instead of classical behavior.
.TP
.BI \-\-umask= umask

before running the scripts.

.I argument
to the scripts.  Use
.B --arg
once for each argument you want passed.

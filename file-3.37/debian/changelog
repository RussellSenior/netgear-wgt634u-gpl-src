  * Implemented internal gzip support through the zlib library. It's much
    faster than executing gzip and it works better. Many small files that
    weren't properly handled now are. I've tested this with over 400 random
    gzipped files and it works, but please, report any problem with this.

    I won't try to implement something to create a compiled version of
    /etc/magic as: 1) This fle is empty by default and will have only a few
    manually added entries, so there wouldn't be any speed gain; 2) It will
    add complexity and it wouldn't be trivial.
  * Added a note in magic2mime(1) deprecating its use.
  * No longer recognizes sunclock's "vector map format" as PostScript
    (closes:Bug#105930).

  * Code for detecting if an input stream is seekable assumed that lseek

    (closes:Bug#16837,Bug#36724,Bug#37838).
  * If the file is ELF and is not seekable, `file' will now copy
    it to a temporary file because the ELF code needs to fseek
    everywhere in the file. The idea was from Adam Heath <adam@doogie.org>.
    (closes:Bug#28964,Bug#70629).
